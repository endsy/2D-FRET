# 2D-FRET
Numerical calculation for energy transfer in 2 dimensions

This python 2.7 script relies on the module FungStryer_FRET to numerically calculate the energy transfer (FRET) 
in a system of donor fluorescent molecules set at some arbitrary distance of closest approach which is perpendicular 
to a 2-D plane of acceptor fluorescent molecules.
